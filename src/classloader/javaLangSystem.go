 Each object or library that has Go methods contains a reference to MethodSignatures,
 which contain data needed to insert the go method into the MTable of the currently
 executing JVM. MethodSignatures is a map whose key is the fully qualified name and
 type of the method (that is, the method's full signature) and a value consisting of
 a struct of an int (the number of slots to pop off the caller's operand stack when
 creating the new frame and a function. All methods have the same signature, regardless
 of the signature of their Java counterparts. That signature is that it accepts a slice
 of interface{} and returns an interface{}. The accepted slice can be empty and the
 return interface can be nil. This covers all Java functions. (Objects are returned
 as a 64-bit address in this scheme (as they are in the JVM).

 The slice contains one entry for every parameter passed to the method (which could
 mean an empty slice). There is no return value, because the method will place any
 return value on the operand stack of the calling function.
