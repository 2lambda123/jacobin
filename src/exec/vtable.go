// VTable is the table in which virtual method data is stored for quick reference at
// method invocation. It consists of a map whose key is a string consisting of a
// concatenation of the class name, method name, and method type. The value consists
// of fields used in the execution of the method: ParamSlots indicates how many slots
// on the calling method's operand stack are items for the called method, a pointer
// to a generic function, and a MethType byte, which indicates what kind of method is
// pointed to by the previous field: 'J' = Java method, 'G' = golang method, and 'N'
// which is a native method in the JNI sense of the term.
