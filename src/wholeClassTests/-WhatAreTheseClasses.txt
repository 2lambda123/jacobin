This directory contains test classes for Jacobin VM. Each one consists of a
class file generated by a Hotspot-based JDK for Java 11.

For each class in this directory, there is a corresponding test file in the
wholeClassTests directory of this project. On Github, it's located at:
https://github.com/platypusguy/jacobin/tree/main/src/wholeClassTests.
The tests there show the source code for the class in the header comments and
how to run the class under various scenarios of verbosity and tracing. To run
the test, change the value in the initVars*.go function to reflect your setup,
then compile and run the test.

On the Jacobin VM development system, a CI suite runs all these tests before
every commit (generally many times before any commit). On Github actions,
however, these tests are not run--only unit tests are run by Github. (This
capability is enabled by the -short flag in the standard go test framework.)
