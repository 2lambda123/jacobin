This directory contains tests for Jacobin VM.

Each file whose name begins with a capital letter exercises a
corresponding Java class file located on Github in this directory:
https://github.com/platypusguy/jacobin/tree/main/testdata. The source
code for each test class is listed in the comments section of the test
file in this directory. If you choose to build the test class yourself,
be sure to use a JDK that corresponds to the same release of Java that
Jacobin VM supports. At present, that is Java 11.

To run a test on its corresponding class, simply change the value in the
initVars*() go function to reflect your setup, then compile and run the test.

Tests that whose file name begin with a lower-case letter do not have a
corresponding class. These are tests for command lines such as:
jacobin -version or jacobin -help.

On the Jacobin VM development system, a CI suite runs all these tests before
every commit (generally many times before any commit). On Github actions,
however, these tests are *not* run--only unit tests are run by Github. (This
capability is enabled by the -short flag of the standard go test framework.)
